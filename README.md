# Graph-Visualization-Framework (GVF)

A scientific framework for visualizing graphs representing different types of entities and connections.
Following the concept of visualizing each type of node in a single graph and connecting it interactively
with the other ones should help to prevent clutter and occlusion.

Later on it should support community analysis tools as well as possibilities to make visual analytics on combined edges.
